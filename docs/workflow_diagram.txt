[This ASCII diagram represents the workflow of the DevOps pipeline:
1. Developer writes code on their workstation
2. Code is pushed to Git/GitHub
3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs tests
4. Code is deployed to Staging for verification
5. If tests pass, code moves to Production
6. Health Check & Monitoring ensures everything works
7. IaC (Terraform/Ansible) manages both environments]
